  "text_1": "I am a Junior Full Stack Developer driven by a passion for creating and solving problems. My journey into the world of programming was not a straight line. For seven years, I worked full-time in a completely different context as a warehouse worker at Laika, where I learned the importance of precision and organization. The desire for a new challenge and dissatisfaction with my job pushed me to make a courageous decision: to change my life. Inspired by my uncle, a developer with years of experience, and driven by my childhood passion for modifying video games, I embarked on a Full Stack Developer Master's program.",
  "text_2": "This Master's degree gave me the tools to transform my creativity into code and my determination into solutions. I realized that programming is not just a job, but a way to build something tangible, just as I used to, but in a completely new world. Today, I am ready to put my skills and insatiable desire to learn to work for a dynamic team and innovative projects. I believe my unique background makes me a versatile professional, capable of facing any challenge with a different perspective and a strong work ethic.",

      "description": "Not just a project, but the beginning of everything. This project, developed during my first Build Week at Epicode, was my baptism into the world of programming. With a team of strangers, assigned by the instructor, and armed only with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, we launched into the challenge of replicating the Spotify interface. We learned to work in a team, managing the workflow with Trello and GitHub, transforming our front-end skills into a functional product. Beyond the code, this project gave life to a solid friendship that still lasts today. This group work is not just a demonstration of my initial technical skills. It's proof that collaboration and passion can turn challenges into successes, creating an unbreakable bond between people. An experience that taught me that the best projects are born from sharing."

This project was developed with the goal of creating an ecosystem where players can easily find the perfect companion or a team to climb the ranks. I designed a system of customizable profiles and intelligent matching that helps users find compatible gaming partners based on tastes and styles. The platform also includes a real-time chat based on WebSocket and exclusive badges to reward dedication to the community. The Technology behind PixelPals Frontend: Developed with React for a dynamic and reactive user interface, and styled with Tailwind CSS for an attractive design. Backend: I used Spring Boot to build a robust backend, supported by a MongoDB database to efficiently manage data. Connectivity: Authentication is managed with JWT, while real-time communication is made possible by WebSocket. This project is not just a demonstration of my technical skills, but also my vision of how technology can create communities and improve the human experience."

    "description": "This is a simple, responsive weather app created in a single afternoon during the first months of my Full Stack Development Master's. The project was conceived as a practical exercise to apply my initial knowledge of web development, particularly using React, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The application focuses on its main function: providing accurate and immediate weather forecasts. It uses an external weather API to retrieve real-time data and displays it in a responsive interface that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The choice of Bootstrap allowed for quick and efficient layout and style management, ensuring a good user experience even with my limited knowledge of CSS at the time. Despite its nature as a learning project, the app demonstrates a solid understanding of basic React principles, API handling, and the creation of functional and accessible user interfaces.",

The main goal was to test and solidify my initial knowledge of React and, in particular, to apply the concepts of Redux for the first time for state management. The app focuses on its main function: a working search bar that makes API calls to retrieve real-time music data. Thanks to the use of Bootstrap, the interface is fully responsive, ensuring smooth navigation on any device. Despite being a learning project made with limited experience at the time, it demonstrates my ability to quickly understand, apply, and integrate new technologies like React, Redux, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a functional and well-structured web application.",

The goal was to challenge my ability to create a complex and fully responsive user interface with React and to handle API calls to connect dynamic data. The application replicates three main sections: a Homepage with dynamic carousels for various categories, a dedicated TV Shows page, and a Details page for each title, with data retrieved in real-time via the IMDB API. Despite the short timeframe, the project demonstrates a solid understanding of React.js, the use of Bootstrap for an efficient layout, and the integration of external APIs to create a dynamic and functional user experience.",
